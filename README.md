## Requirements and install

Use Android 9 or newer on a supported Adreno device (730 or newer, or 8xx). Adreno 6xx is experimental: DirectX 11 uses DXVK 2 and may run, and DirectX 12 games can still crash. Mali, Xclipse, PowerVR, and Adreno 710 are unsupported. No root is required. Allow about 3 GB for the runtime and 1.1 GB more for the desktop and emulators. Install the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/Droid-Deck/DroidDeck/releases), install the Linux runtime, then press **Play** and sign in. Steam downloads on first launch. Install **Desktop & apps** to use the desktop and emulators. The **Store** installs Linux apps and games from Flathub (ARM64 builds) with Flatpak; with additional options to install Appimages and set up scripts. **Stores** (Setup › Stores › "Show Stores in the rail") signs in to GOG, Epic Games and Amazon Games, browses their catalogs and libraries, downloads games into the Games storage and adds each one to the Steam client as a non-Steam game, so it launches through Proton like everything else; the cog on its chip row sets which tab a store opens on, whether installs go to Steam, and the download speed tier.

Before Steam launches, you must turn off **Restrict child processes** in Developer options. If this option is not available in developer settings (Android 12 and 13 devices), first launch of Steam will present a "Fix it for me" button, which will help automate the setup process.

## Community

Join the [DroidDeck Discord](https://discord.gg/JRGAvawjsm) for help, Preview builds, and device reports. Bug reports go in its **#bug-reports** forum; attach the session folder from `Download/DroidDeck/` so the logs come with it.

## Build

Run `tools/build_local.sh` with Docker, Java 17, the Android SDK/NDK, and `zstd` installed. It builds the ARM64 audio sinks from PulseAudio 13.0 and packages them into the APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Set `DROIDDECK_PA13_SOURCE_DIR` to an existing PulseAudio 13.0 source directory to skip downloading it. To install the APK on an attached device, run `tools/deploy_local.sh`.

## Limits

Compatibility and performance vary by device; hardware validation is limited. Desktop compositing uses software rendering. Firefox sandboxing is reduced under proot. See the session logs in `Download/DroidDeck/` when diagnosing problems.

## Credits and licence

GPL-3.0. Runtime, shim, input, and controller work build on WinNative and Bannerlator (maxjivi05). LSFG frame generation is from the work of Camille LaVey and the [Eden](https://eden-emu.dev) emulator project, following [lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk), ported to WinNative and DroidDeck by [@maxjivi05](https://github.com/maxjivi05); it needs your own copy of [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/) and ships none of its shaders. x86 AppImages, and any whose own runtime cannot unpack them, are unpacked with [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime) by VHSgunzo (MIT), shipped unmodified with its licence. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). Steam and Proton belong to Valve Corporation; this project is not affiliated with Valve.
